# software-design-patterns
This repository contains implementations of Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns and SOLID principles using Java 25 and Spring Boot.

Spring Boot is used as a container to execute all design patterns and principles through a CommandLineRunner. Each design pattern or principle is organized into its respective package for clarity and maintainability.

The project also demonstrates the ability to execute independent tasks concurrently using threads or virtual threads.


**Project Objectives:** 

- Implement and illustrate Creational, Structural, and Behavioral design patterns

- Apply SOLID principles in a structured, modular way

- Maintain a clear package structure for easy navigation and learning

- Enable execution of patterns and principles in parallel where appropriate

- Serve as a reference for best practices in software design
